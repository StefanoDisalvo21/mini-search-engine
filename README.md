# Mini Search Engine 🗂️

## About
    The project itself is a search engine, obviously
    a very basic one but it has been thought 
    to be a practice and a way to learn.

    The project started in September 2025 at
    the start of my last year of High School
    because I wanted to do more than a regular
    HS student so I started reading books
    about code and related topics and work 
    on projects like this.

    Update (October 2025):
    The goals that I set at the beginning
    of the project took more or less
    a month to be reached, all this month
    of working taught me so much, as already
    said this is my first project as an HS student
    not enrolled in university yet, the user experience 
    is very poor with basic interaction
    but the goal was only on the logic
    since it is what I do really love.
    Anyway I really enjoyed working on this and 
    I want to push even more and learn
    more to get better everyday at what I love.
    

## Goals 🎯
    - Learn About Algorithms
    - Learn About Data Structures
    - Learn how to tokenize 
    - Learn how ranking works 
    - Learn how to work with git with the aim to be able to help and give 
    contributions in open source projects
    - Learn how to write tests using "Google Test".

# Useful info
    The project uses the [ICU (International Components for Unicode)]
    (https://icu.unicode.org/) library to handle strings.

# Status
    The project is now ended (current date: October 2025).

    The main goal of implementing indexing, 
    tokenization and tf-idf search has been reached.
    Although the goal has been achieved, the project
    could become active again to be improved in the
    future.
