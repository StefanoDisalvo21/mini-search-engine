# Mini Search Engine 🗂️

## About
    The project itself is a search engine, obviously
    a very basic one but it has been thought 
    to be a practice and a way to learn.

    The project started in September 2025 at
    the start of my last year of High School
    because I wanted to do more than a regular
    HS student so I started reading books
    about code and related topics and work 
    on projects like this.
