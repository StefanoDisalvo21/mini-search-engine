# Mini Search Engine 🗂️

## About
    The project itself is a search engine, obviously
    a very basic one but it has been thought 
    to be a practice and a way to learn.

    The project started in September 2025 at
    the start of my last year of High School
    because I wanted to do more than a regular
    HS student so I started reading books
    about code and related topics and work 
    on projects like this.

## Goals 🎯
    - Learn About Algorithms
    - Learn About Data Structures
    - Learn how to tokenize 
    - Learn how ranking works 
    - Learn how to work with git with the aim to be able to help and give 
    contributions in open source projects
    - Learn how to write tests using "Google Test".

# Useful info
    The project uses the [ICU (International Components for Unicode)]
    (https://icu.unicode.org/) library to handle strings.

    ICU is distributed under the [ICU License]
    (https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/LICENSE),
    a permissive open source license.

# Status
    The project is active.
    The main goal of implementing indexing, 
    tokenization and tf-idf search has been reached.

    Although the goal has been achieved I plan to keep
    working on the project, so I am studying hwo to add new
    features and make it more accurate and efficient.
    Updates will be likely to be less frequent than
    they were during the initial phase  of the project 
    but new features are planned to be delivered as soon 
    as possible.
